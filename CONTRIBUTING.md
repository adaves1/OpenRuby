# Contributing to OpenRuby

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenRuby! We appreciate your time and effort in making our project better.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/adaves1/issues).
- Clearly describe the problem, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- Attach relevant logs, screenshots, or videos that can help us understand the issue better.
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates before submitting a new one.
- If the issue is security-related, please follow the instructions in our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

### 2. Code Contributions
- Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
- Make your changes and ensure they follow our code style guidelines.
- Test your changes thoroughly.
- Submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes.
- Link the related issue if applicable.
- Keep your pull request focused on one issue or feature at a time.
- Clearly explain the reasoning behind the changes and their potential impact.
- Document new public APIs or components where necessary.
- Update relevant documentation files if your contribution affects how users interact with the project.

### 3. Code Review Process
- All pull requests will go through a review process.
- Make sure your code adheres to our [coding standards](https://github.com/adaves1/OpenRuby-Library/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
- Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.
- Request reviews from appropriate reviewers or maintainers.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main` before requesting a merge.
- If requested changes are not addressed within 30 days, the pull request may be closed.
- Engage in constructive discussions during the review process and seek to understand reviewer feedback.

### 4. Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Use present tense and include a summary of the change (e.g., "Fix bug in X" or "Add Y feature").
- Use descriptive commits rather than generic messages like "Fixes" or "Update".
- Group related changes into a single commit.
- Use conventional commit format if applicable (e.g., "feat: add new login form").
- Reference issues in commit messages using `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`.

- Use `prettier` or `black` to ensure code is consistently formatted.
- Set up pre-commit hooks to catch common errors before submission.
- Run linters and fix any warnings or errors before committing.
- Follow environment-specific instructions in the `README.md` to avoid configuration issues.

### 6. Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features.
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting code.
- Aim for at least 90% code coverage.
- Use automated test frameworks like Jest, Pytest, or equivalent.
- Document complex tests with comments to explain the intent behind them.
- If a bug fix is submitted, include a test that verifies the fix.
